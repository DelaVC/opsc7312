# Open Source Coding (Intermediate) (OPSC7312)

This repository contains the example code for OPSC7312.

Each Learning Unit has its own folder. And tags have been created so you can checkout code up to a specific section in the module manual.

For the BasicWeatherApp in Learning Unit 1, you need to add you own AccuWeather API key. Otherwise, the Gradle build will not even succeed. Follow these steps:

1. Create a file called apikey.properties in the root folder of the project.
2. Add the following property to the file: ACCUWEATHER_API_KEY="key"
3. Remember to replace key with your own API key.
  
Read Learning Unit 1 Section 1 of the Module Manual for more information.
